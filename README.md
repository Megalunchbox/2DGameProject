# 2DGameProject

2DGameProject is a project to create a sort of sandbox game (like terraria or starbound) but with a more clear objective, obviously it won't be perfect because it's my first game but its a start. 

If any other beginners want to submit a pull request - create your own branch i'll review it and open it, depending on whether it fits what i am doing.
